## How to Play
Players take turns to roll a dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to their current score.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and it's the next player's turn.
A player can choose to 'Hold', which means their current score gets added to their total score. After this, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on their total score wins the game.
